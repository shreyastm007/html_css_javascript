** React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called Virtual DOM.
This “virtual” representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.

** When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one.
This comparison is done by Diffing Algorithm.

** With the help of this Algorithm React figures out which components in the UI needs to be updated. 
This process is called diffing. The algorithm that is used for the diffing process is called as the diffing algorithm. 
Once React knows which components has been updated, then it replaces the original DOM nodes with the updated DOM node.


ex:initial dom

<section>
         <div>
               <h1>Hello React</h1>
         </div>
         <div>
               <h1>Hello React 2</h1>
         </div>
</section>



Updated DOM

<section>
         <div>
               <h1>Hello React</h1>
         </div>
         <div>
               <h1>Hello React 5</h1>
         </div>
</section>


** Now here when there is update in the UI then react compares the new virtual DOM with the pre-updated virtual DOM and points out that in the second <div> the content has been changed 
so it only updates the content of the second div in the real DOM.
Like this diffing algorithm will work.
